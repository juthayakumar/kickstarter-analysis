# Kickstarting with Excel
## Overview of Project
### Purpose
  The purpose of this project was to compare the launch dates and funding goals of different campaigns. The project helped to determine and visualize how campaigns performed in their outcomes based off their launch dates and funding goals.
## Analysis and Challenges
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date  
There is a lot of information that came from analyzing the outcomes based on launch date. One thing that stood out to me was that there were very few canceled campaigns, so it can be assumed that whether campaigns were successful or they failed, they atleast managed to take off for the most part. The table below will help to show that.

We can also see that throughout every month, there were always more successful campaigns than there were failed campaigns. This portion of the table will show that.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
The most successful campaigns were in the less than $1000 range up to $5000.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
The main challenge that I encountered was with the table in the Outcomes Based on Goals. I was not able to apply the function properly to get the right number of successful, failed, and canceled cases. This was solved by working on my functions with a TA, and once I figured out my mistake, I was able to continue forward with the table and get the correct values to create an identical chart compared to the example the module had.  
## Results
- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date? Two conclusions I can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date are:
 
	1) The summer months had the most success with numbers, as opposed to the other months, so it can be concluded that campaigns in the summer would be the most successful.
		  
	2) The campaigns were overall a success because each month had more successful campaigns than it did failed ones.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals? 
 
 	I can conclude that more people were prepared to donate less than $15000 to the campaigns, with the highest numbers being less than $5000, so it can be said that limiting her goal to $15000 would be a better option. 

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
 
	A limitation of the dataset is when looking at the table and graph in the Outcomes Based on Goals, it may be easy to assume that the $35000-$45000 range of goals were successful based off of the percentage, but when looking at the chart we can see that the number of campaigns in total for those ranges is small. Another limitation is that there was no social media campaign which in this day and age would be the best way to reach people. I think that when it comes to any kind of research, there needs to be a social media avenue as discussed in class, making it easier to complete surveys and/or collect funds.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
 
	I believe using a clustered bar graph could make it easy to visualize the information, such as in the picture below.
